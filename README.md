üìå Project Overview

Skin cancer and dermatological diseases are a growing health concern worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. DermoAI is a deep learning‚Äìbased project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify different types of skin lesions from dermatoscopic images.

The project is built using the HAM10000 dataset (Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images), which is a well-known benchmark dataset in dermatology research.

The main objective:

Train a CNN model on dermatoscopic images

Classify lesions into 7 categories (e.g., melanocytic nevi, melanoma, benign keratosis, etc.)

Provide a foundation for AI-powered dermatological diagnosis

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools Used

Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow / Keras

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Image Processing: OpenCV / PIL

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

üìÇ Dataset ‚Äì HAM10000

Source: HAM10000 dataset

Contains 10,015 dermatoscopic images of pigmented lesions

Images are labeled into 7 diagnostic categories:

Melanocytic nevi (nv)

Melanoma (mel)

Benign keratosis (bkl)

Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)

Actinic keratoses (akiec)

Vascular lesions (vasc)

Dermatofibroma (df)

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow / Methodology
